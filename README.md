Golang client for [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org). The goal of this library is to make an "ORM-like" restful interface.

## Documentation

Full documentation can be found [here](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/webody-inc/postgrest-go).

## Testing

Some tests are implemented to run against mocked Postgrest endpoints. Optionally, tests can be run against an actual Postgrest instance by setting a `POSTGREST_URL` environment variable to the fully-qualified URL to a Postgrest instance, and, optionally, an `API_KEY` environment variable (if, for example, testing against a local Supabase instance).

A [script](test/seed.sql) is included in the test directory that can be used to seed the test database.

To run all tests:

```bash
go test ./...
```
